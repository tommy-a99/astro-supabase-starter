				"A healthy life isn’t just about avoiding sickness—it’s about thriving. Small, consistent choices like drinking water, eating whole foods, staying active, and managing stress compound over time, creating a ripple effect of well-being. It’s like investing in yourself: the earlier you start, the bigger the payoff. Plus, it sets a great example for others, like kids or peers, to follow suit.",
